## CodeBook Getting and Cleaning Data

The data used is from the UCI machine learning repository. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The run_analysis.R script performs the data downloading, tidying, and creates a new table. 

1. The data is firstly downloaded, zip files are unzipped, and the data are read.
2. Downloaded data are read in. Features contains the different measurement features, activities contains 6 levels of activity (i.e. walking, standing, etc), the test and train data contain information on the training and test data per subject.
```
features <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt", header=F, col.names=c("featurecode", "feature"))
activities <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt", header=F, col.names=c("activitycode", "activity"))
subject_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt", header=F, col.names="subject")
x_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt", header=F, col.names = features$feature)
y_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/Y_test.txt", header=F, col.names="activitycode")
subject_train <- read.csv("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt", header=F, col.names="subject")
x_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt", header=F, col.names=features$feature)
y_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/Y_train.txt", header=F, col.names = "activitycode")
```
3. Data are then merged, first by Train and Test, then all together.
```
Train <- cbind(subject_train, y_train, x_train)
Test <- cbind(subject_test, y_test, x_test)
Complete <- rbind(Train, Test)
```
4. Labels are renamed for readability. 
5. A new dataset is selected by group and activity, and each variable is averaged.
6. A table is made for the new data and is saved as a txt file.
